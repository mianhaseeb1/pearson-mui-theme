### Avatar
The first set of two avatars are used as icon buttons. They are often wrapped around IconButton.

The second set is an example of Avatar wrapped in an IconButton. Notice the hover color is enabled for the 
first one and disabled for second one.

The third set of avatars is used in profile displays.
