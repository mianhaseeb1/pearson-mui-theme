Visit [Icons](https://uxframework.pearson.com/nightly/icons) in Pearson UX specifications.
Pearson icons are available in two sizes, 18x18 and 24x24 pixels. You can incorporate them 
into your code by passing params.

**Always wrap the icons inside an IconButton when you are using icons for action.**
