### Clickable Cards
Never use onClick on Cards. They create accessibility issues 
(Read up: [Never Use Tabstops](https://one-confluence.pearson.com/display/CED/React+and+Material+UI+Standards)).
The preferred way would be to wrap the Card on a text button as shown below. The other option would be to use 
CardClickArea (Example: 3rd card).
